ZeroTier Python Client
======

This python library is to be used as/in a client to the ZerotierOne service.

When it is used as a stand alone script, it can either be used to interface with the node or the controller. To use it as a controller client, invoke it as zt1ctrl (ln -s zt1.py zt1ctrl) or start with the --ctrl argument. The minimal controler version is 1.0.4.
